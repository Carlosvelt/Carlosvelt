## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Carlosvelt/Carlosvelt** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
My name is Carlos. I'm actually studying a maths degree in Salamanca. I'm also keen on finance and sports.
I'm looking to getting used to finance libraries and python programming in general, having touched C & Wolfram.
I'd like to get into the financial sector once I finish my degree, as I have been a finance and economic enthusiast since highschool.
I love maths as well and I'd like to combine both skills to get a living out of it.
